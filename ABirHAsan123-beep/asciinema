__asciinema__ (aka asciinema CLI or asciinema recorder) is a command-line tool
for recording terminal sessions.

Unlike typical _screen_ recording software, which records visual output of a
screen into a heavyweight video files (`.mp4`, `.mov`), asciinema recorder runs
_inside a terminal_, capturing terminal session output into a lightweight
recording files in the
[asciicast](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/asciicast/v2/) format (`.cast`).

The recordings can be replayed in a terminal, embedded on a web page with the
[asciinema player](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/), or published to
an [asciinema server](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/server/), such as
[asciinema.org](https://asciinema.org), for further sharing.

Notable features:

* [recording](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/cli/usage/#asciinema-rec-filename)
  and
  [replaying](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/cli/usage/#asciinema-play-filename)
  of sessions inside a terminal,
* live streaming of terminal sessions, with local HTTP server mode, and a relay
  forwarding mode,
* [light-weight recording
  format](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/asciicast/v2/), which is highly
  compressible (down to 15% of the original size e.g. with `zstd` or `gzip`),
* integration with [asciinema
  server](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/server/), e.g.
  [asciinema.org](https://asciinema.org), for easy recording hosting.

To record a session run this command in your shell:

```sh
asciinema rec demo.cast
```

To stream a session via built-in HTTP server run:

```sh
asciinema stream --serve
```

To stream a session via a relay (asciinema server) run:

```sh
asciinema stream --relay
```

Check out the [Getting started
guide](https://docs.asciinema.org/getting-started/) for installation and usage
overview.

## Building

Building asciinema from source requires the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
compiler (1.70 or later), and the [Cargo package
manager](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). If they are not available via your
system package manager then use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

To download the source code, build the asciinema binary, and install it in
`$HOME/.cargo/bin` run:

```sh
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema
```

Then, ensure `$HOME/.cargo/bin` is in your shell's `$PATH`.

Alternatively, you can manually download the source code and build the asciinema
binary with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema
cd asciinema
cargo build --release
```

This produces the binary in _release mode_ (`--release`) at
`target/release/asciinema`. You can just copy the binary to a directory in your
`$PATH`.

To generate man pages and shell completion files, set `ASCIINEMA_GEN_DIR` to the
path where these artifacts should be stored. For example:

```sh
ASCIINEMA_GEN_DIR=/foo cargo build --release
```

The above command will build the binary and place the man pages in `/foo/man/`,
and the shell completion files in the `/foo/completion/` directory.

> Windows is currently not supported. _(See [#467](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/issues/467))_

## Development

This branch contains the next generation of the asciinema CLI, written in Rust
([about the
rewrite](https://discourse.asciinema.org/t/rust-rewrite-of-the-asciinema-cli/777)).
It is still in a work-in-progress stage, so if you wish to propose any code
changes, please first reach out to the team via
[forum](https://discourse.asciinema.org/),
[Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#asciinema:matrix.org) or
[IRC](https://web.libera.chat/#asciinema).

The previous generation of the asciinema CLI, written in Python, can be found in
the `main` branch.
